# College_Assignment_GUI
Work developed for the Graphic User Interface (GUI) subject in the third semester.
The job consisted of creating an app for hairdressers and clients.
Hairdressers would make their schedules available and clients could search for salons near their home and schedule an appointment.
Using Java to create the screens and MySQL for the database. Account creation, user login and appointments.
The backend part of the job was worth extra points.
